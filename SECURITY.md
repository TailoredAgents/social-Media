## 🚨 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take all security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 🔴 Critical/High Severity Issues

For critical or high severity security issues:

1. **DO NOT** create a public issue
2. Email us directly at: **security@aisocialagent.com**
3. Include detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Provide steps to reproduce the issue
5. Include potential impact assessment

### 🟡 Medium/Low Severity Issues

For medium or low severity issues:

1. Create a private security advisory on GitHub
2. Use the "Report a vulnerability" button in the Security tab
3. Provide detailed description and reproduction steps

### 📋 What to Include in Your Report

Please include the following information:

- **Vulnerability Type**: What type of security issue is it?
- **Location**: Where in the codebase is the vulnerability?
- **Impact**: What could an attacker accomplish?
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce
- **Mitigation**: Any suggested fixes or workarounds
- **Discovery**: How did you find this vulnerability?

## ⏱️ Response Timeline

We are committed to responding to security reports promptly:

- **Critical Issues**: Response within 24 hours
- **High Severity**: Response within 48 hours  
- **Medium Severity**: Response within 1 week
- **Low Severity**: Response within 2 weeks

## 🏆 Security Recognition

We believe in recognizing security researchers who help improve our security:

### 🎖️ Hall of Fame

Security researchers who report valid vulnerabilities will be:

- Listed in our Security Hall of Fame (with permission)
- Credited in release notes for fixes
- Provided with project swag (for significant findings)

### 🚫 What We Don't Consider Vulnerabilities

The following are generally not considered security vulnerabilities:

- Issues requiring physical access to a user's device
- Issues in third-party dependencies without proof of exploitability
- Social engineering attacks
- Issues requiring highly privileged access
- Theoretical attacks without practical exploitation
- Issues already covered by existing mitigations

## 🔧 Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | ✅ Fully supported |
| 0.9.x   | ⚠️ Critical fixes only |
| < 0.9   | ❌ No longer supported |
