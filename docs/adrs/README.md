# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for the AI Social Media Content Agent project. ADRs document the significant architectural decisions made during the project development, providing context, rationale, and consequences for future reference.

## Current ADRs

| ADR | Title | Status | Date | Authors |
|-----|-------|---------|------|---------|
| [ADR-001](./ADR-001-architecture-overview.md) | Core Architecture Overview | âœ… Accepted | 2025-07-27 | Infrastructure & DevOps Agent (Tailored Agents) |
| [ADR-002](./ADR-002-ai-integration-strategy.md) | AI Integration Strategy | âœ… Accepted | 2025-07-27 | Backend & Integration Agent (Tailored Agents) |
| [ADR-003](./ADR-003-testing-strategy.md) | Testing Strategy and Framework Selection | âœ… Accepted | 2025-07-27 | All Agents - Tailored Agents |

## ADR Status Definitions

- **ðŸŸ¢ Accepted** - Decision has been approved and implemented
- **ðŸŸ¡ Proposed** - Decision is under consideration
- **ðŸ”´ Deprecated** - Decision has been superseded by a newer ADR
- **âšª Superseded** - Decision has been replaced (links to replacement)

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: Title

**Status:** [Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Authors:** [Agent names or team members]
**Tags:** [relevant, tags, for, categorization]

## Context
[Describe the problem or situation requiring a decision]

## Decision
[State the decision that was made]

## Rationale
[Explain why this decision was made, including alternatives considered]

## Consequences
[Describe the positive and negative impacts of this decision]

## Alternatives Considered
[List other options that were evaluated]

## References
[Links to relevant documentation, discussions, or resources]
```

## How to Create New ADRs

1. **Identify the Need:** When making significant architectural decisions that will impact:
   - System architecture or design patterns
   - Technology stack choices
   - Integration strategies
   - Performance or security approaches
   - Development processes or methodologies

2. **Create the ADR:**
   ```bash
   # Create new ADR file with sequential number
   touch docs/adrs/ADR-00X-decision-title.md
   ```

3. **Follow the Template:** Use the standard ADR format shown above

4. **Collaborate:** For significant decisions, involve multiple team members/agents

5. **Review and Approve:** Ensure the ADR is reviewed before marking as "Accepted"

6. **Update Index:** Add the new ADR to this README file

## ADR Guidelines

### When to Create an ADR
- **Major architectural changes** that affect multiple components
- **Technology selection** decisions with long-term impact
- **Integration patterns** that establish system boundaries
- **Performance or security** trade-offs with significant implications
- **Development process** changes that affect team workflow

### What NOT to Document as ADRs
- Minor implementation details or bug fixes
- Temporary workarounds or patches
- Personal preferences without architectural impact
- Decisions that can be easily reversed

### ADR Quality Standards
- **Clear Context:** Explain the problem and constraints thoroughly
- **Justified Decision:** Provide clear rationale for the chosen approach
- **Alternative Analysis:** Document other options and why they were rejected
- **Impact Assessment:** Describe both positive and negative consequences
- **Future Considerations:** Include thoughts on evolution and maintenance

## Project-Specific Considerations

### Multi-Agent Development
This project uses a multi-agent development approach with specialized agents:
- **Infrastructure & DevOps Agent:** Focuses on CI/CD, deployment, and system reliability
- **Frontend & Quality Agent:** Handles UI/UX and testing strategies
- **Backend & Integration Agent:** Manages APIs, databases, and external integrations

ADRs should reflect this collaborative approach and consider impacts across all agent domains.

### Technology Stack Decisions
Key technology choices documented in ADRs:
- **Frontend:** React 18 with TypeScript, TanStack Query, Auth0
- **Backend:** FastAPI with SQLAlchemy, Celery, Redis
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with FAISS for vector search
- **AI Integration:** CrewAI with OpenAI GPT-5 and GPT-5 Mini and custom tools
- **Infrastructure:** Docker, GitHub Actions, comprehensive testing

### Performance and Scale Considerations
ADRs should address:
- **Enterprise Scale:** Decisions must support enterprise-level usage
- **Performance Targets:** Sub-200ms API responses, <2s frontend loads
- **AI Integration:** Considerations for AI service costs and latency
- **Social Media APIs:** Rate limiting and quota management strategies

## ADR Maintenance

### Regular Reviews
- **Quarterly Review:** Assess if existing ADRs are still relevant
- **Technology Updates:** Update ADRs when underlying technologies change
- **Performance Analysis:** Review decisions based on actual performance data
- **User Feedback:** Consider ADR updates based on production usage

### Deprecation Process
When superseding an ADR:
1. Mark the old ADR as "Superseded"
2. Link to the replacement ADR
3. Explain the reason for the change
4. Update any dependent documentation

### Version Control
- All ADRs are version controlled with the project codebase
- Changes to ADRs should be tracked through commit history
- Major revisions should be discussed with the full development team
